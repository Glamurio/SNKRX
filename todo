Roguelite update:
  Technical improvements:
    Spawn tech: spawn every entity in a grid, before spawning check to see if grid position is clear, this will prevent any issues due to entities spawning inside one another
    Battle stats: DPS, damage taken, etc (check Underlords)
    Tag system: similar to PoE
    Keyword explanations: similar to StS or Artifact, simply create additional text windows for keywords and what they mean
    Key rebinding (for non-QWERTY keyboards)
  StS-like map with nodes, node types:
    Arena
    Elite
    Boss
    Map (map of bigger size than arena with fixed spawns)
    Unit shop
    Item shop
      Once there are enough items there can be item tiers
      The item shop should work similarly to the normal shop, where it can be upgraded and then have a higher chance for higher tier items
    Text + reward
    Training grounds (upgrade unit)
    Tavern (heal units)
    Challenge + reward
      Go through the labyrinth without hitting any walls
      Go through the traps without getting hit
  Units die permanently when they die (dead units can be stored in bench to be revived later)
  Units can have items attached to them like in Underlords
  Unit item ideas:
    This unit's projectiles pierce/chain/fork/seek/split/stun/etc
    This unit is a [class]
  New stat system:
    Most stats are values from 1 to 10 (can be lower than 1 or higher than 10 due to debuffs/buffs) that represent consistent internal values between all units
    i.e. 3 attack speed means the same internal attack rate value (like say 6 seconds) for the entire game
    In general it's better if units don't have hidden internal multipliers on these stats, although sometimes that may be inevitable
    Damage:
      Damage type:
        Attack - physical attacks, decreased by the enemy's armor
        Spell - magical attacks, decreased by the enemy's magic resistance
      Attack type:
        Crash - damage dealt when bumping into enemies
        Projectile - damage dealt by projectiles
        AoE - damage dealt in an area
        DoT - damage dealt over time
    Attack speed:
    Defense:
      Armor - decreases damage taken from attacks
      Magic Resistance - decreases damage taken from spells
    Movement speed:
